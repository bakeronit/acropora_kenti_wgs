We use analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) to test for associations
between inversion genotypes and two key ecological factors structuring
our samples. The first of these inshore/offshore corresponds to major
differences in turbidity, salinity, temperature variability and
proximity to terrestrial inputs (nutrients, agricultural chemicals etc).

We used the `amova` function in the poppr package to test whether
genetic variance among sites distributed across both shores
(inshore/offshore) was greater than within shore. A model with reef
nested within shore was used to account for the fact that samples were
taken in groups from 9 reefs and randtest with 999 repeats was used to
test the significance of variance components @Excoffier1992-pe through
random permutations of the data. No variance component in this analysis
was statistically stignificant (p\>0.2).

| locus |    statphi | pvalue |
|:------|-----------:|-------:|
| L1    | -0.0986722 |  0.889 |
| L2    | -0.0567917 |  0.835 |
| L3    |  0.0332071 |  0.234 |
| L4    | -0.0267604 |  0.560 |
| L5    | -0.1087607 |  0.920 |

To test whether symbiont type was associated with inversion haplotype we
conducted AMOVA again but this time with the model ~symbiont/reef where
symbiont was coded according to whether the colony harboured C1 or C2.
All colonies with uncertain dominant symbiont were excluded.
