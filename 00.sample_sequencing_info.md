Samples and sequencing information
================

*Acropora kenti* corals were collected from both 5 inshore and 4
offshore locations on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR).

- Inshore reefs
  - Magnetic Island (MI, n=28)
  - Pandora Reef (PR, n=30)
  - Pelorus Island (PI, n=30)
  - Dunk Island (DI, n=30)
  - Fitzroy Island (FI, n=30)
- Offshore reefs
  - Arlington Reef (ARL, n=20)
  - Taylor Reef (TAY, n=20)
  - Rib Reef (RIB, n=20)
  - John Brewer Reef (JB, n=20)

The extracted DNA was sequenced at shallow depth **(~2-5x)** with 100bp
paired sequences. Some samples were sequenced in multiple lines or
flowcells, thus, one sample has several fastq files.

> Two samples (FI-1-3, MI-1-4) were sequenced at much higher depth ~20x.
> Aside from some specific analyses (eg structural variant dection)
> these files were down-sampled to average depth based on random
> selection of mapped reads from their bam files.

Data were sequenced in two batches. The first batch is from a previously
[published
study](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abc6318). The
second was specifically sequenced for the present study.

- **Data of inshore reefs from Cooke et al 2020**

  Each sample was sequenced in 2 lanes with paired-end reads, thus, 592
  fastq files were generated from 148 samples.

- **Data of offshore reefs. This study**

  80 samples, each with 2 lanes and 2 batches, from 640 fastq files.

**Sequencing data summary**

Data yield per sample ranged from 0.423-2.49Gbp.Based on a genome size
of 487Mb (486,812,518), samples were sequenced at 0.87X-5.12X depths
(except for two high sequencing depth samples: 23.84X,11.6Gbp;
25.90X,12.6Gbp).
